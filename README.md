# Microfrontends in Angular

An interactive slide deck that I created for a talk about microfrontends in Angular. While it is a slide deck for use during a talk, it also uses microfrontends itself as a working example. 

This repository was built using Manfred Steyer's [extremely useful repository](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/module-federation-plugin-example) as a starting point.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
